		<h1>Chandini Chowk</h1>
		<p>
			Short description about the project.
			<br>
			<br>
			The image given above as banner belongs to this <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F280489883030666268%2F&psig=AOvVaw1t0EdMpqZPtJRJW0MYczBA&ust=1631377095655000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCPjR77Pn9PICFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD">link</a>. This image is a sketch of chandini chowk taken from google images.

			Everything right here is just an example of our basic layout of the site.
			Banners will be changed, colors might also get replaced, fonts wil update and the site will match the category and theme.
			<br>
			<br>
			All the text here is not real.
			Most of the text lying here will also be replaced.
			<br>
			<br>
			The things like banner position and size will remain. Custom context menu(right click menu) and the scroll to up will sustain as well.
			<br>
			<br>
			All the buttons do work as intended.
			<br>
			<br>
			Here is some extra text so that buttons can be tested. Click on visible buttons. Right click to access context menu.
			<br>
			<br>
			This page is very responsive.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="navigation">
		<h1>Navigation</h1>
		<p>
			Here there will be button ui. This are is for navigation.
			For now as no images and graphics are present exactly, text should do for now.
			Due to scarcity of data because of the problems to go market physically, the buttons go no where. For the final conclusion these buttons are just about appearance for now.
